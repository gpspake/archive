    <p>I just wanted to learn about native search features in SQLite and I accidentally built a website.</p>

    <h2>Search</h2>
    <p>The search demo on the <a href="/releases">releases page</a> uses <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html">PostgreSQL Full Text Search (FTS)</a> so partial search terms like "que" will return no results while "queen's" will match "queen." Trigram tokenization can be used for partial searches but there are tradeoffs so the right choice depends on the application. Either option is a convenient starting point for implementing search with minimal complexity. For cases where native PostgreSQL features don't meet the requirements, there are plenty of established search patterns and solutions available.</p>

    <p class="text-blue-700"><i>Compare this demo to <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800" href="https://simple-web-app.georgespake.com">the same app using SQLite and the FTS5 extension for substring matching </a></i></p>

    <h2>HTMX</h2>
    <p>HTMX is used in the search demo for partial client-side re-rendering of search results and pagination. There's no build required, it's just a tiny static js file that's only loaded on the releases page. All the client-side functionality it provides in the demo is based on a few html attributes. Check out the
        <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx website</a> to learn more.</p>
